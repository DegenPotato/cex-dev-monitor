# Reverse Animation Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Been Added

### **1. Reverse Animation State**
- Added `isReversing` state to track reverse animation
- Added `handleBackClick` callback to trigger reverse
- Back button added to auth billboard UI

### **2. Reverse Animation Timeline**
```typescript
else if (isReversing) {
    // Reverse animation - return to landing page
    controls.enabled = false;
    
    gsap.timeline({ 
        onComplete: () => { 
            controls.enabled = true; 
            setIsReversing(false);
            setIsTransitioning(false);
        }
    })
      // Hide billboard and vortex
      .to(billboardMaterial, { opacity: 0, duration: 0.3 }, 0)
      .to(borderGlowMaterial, { opacity: 0, duration: 0.3 }, 0)
      .to(vortexMaterial.uniforms.uIntensity, { value: 0, duration: 0.5 }, 0)
      
      // Camera returns to starting position
      .to(camera.position, { 
          x: 0,
          y: 0,
          z: 15, 
          duration: 2.5, 
          ease: 'power3.out' 
      }, 0.3)
      
      // Reset camera rotation
      .to(camera.rotation, {
          x: 0,
          y: 0,
          z: 0,
          duration: 2.0,
          ease: 'power2.out'
      }, 0.3)
      
      // Reset post-processing
      .to(bloomPass, { strength: 1.0, duration: 2 }, 0.3)
      .to(lensingPass.uniforms.uStrength, { value: 0.05, duration: 2.5 }, 0.3)
      .to(lensingPass.uniforms.uRadius, { value: 0.25, duration: 2.5 }, 0.3)
      .to(chromaticAberrationPass.uniforms.uAberrationAmount, { value: 0.002, duration: 2.0 }, 0.3)
      .to(camera, { fov: 75, duration: 2, onUpdate: () => camera.updateProjectionMatrix() }, 0.3);
}
```

### **3. Back Button UI**
- Arrow icon in top-left of auth billboard
- Triggers `handleBackClick` when clicked
- Cyan color matching the theme

## ⚠️ Current Issues

### **Compilation Errors**
The file has multiple TypeScript errors that need to be resolved for the reverse animation to work properly. Many variables are out of scope or not properly defined.

### **Expected Behavior**
1. User clicks "ENTER" → Camera flies to singularity → Auth billboard appears
2. User clicks back arrow → Billboard fades out → Camera flies back to z=15 → Landing page UI reappears
3. User can click "ENTER" again to restart the cycle

### **Actual Behavior**
Back button click doesn't trigger proper reverse animation due to compilation errors.

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **Fix compilation errors** - Many variable scope issues
2. **Test reverse animation** - Ensure camera returns to starting position
3. **Verify UI state** - Landing page should reappear after reverse
4. **Test re-entry** - User should be able to click "ENTER" again

---

## 📝 Notes

- Removed all `isReturning` references (old deprecated variable)
- Replaced with `isReversing` for the back animation
- Controls are disabled during both forward and reverse transitions
- Landing page UI hides during both transitions (`isTransitioning || isReversing`)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. Test the back button functionality
3. Verify smooth reverse animation
4. Ensure landing page reappears properly
