# System Test Checklist

## ✅ Components Fixed and Ready

### 1. Rate Limiting (FIXED ✅)
- **Before**: 429 errors with public RPC
- **After**: All services use Helius (100K req/day)
- **Config**: 500ms rate limiter on wallet analysis

### 2. Duplicate Transaction Processing (FIXED ✅)
- **Before**: Same transactions processed 3-5x
- **After**: Processing locks + in-memory cache
- **Result**: Zero duplicate processing

### 3. Recipient Detection (FIXED ✅)
- **Before**: Tracking signers instead of recipients
- **After**: Finds largest positive balance change
- **Result**: Correctly identifies SOL recipients

### 4. Fresh Wallet Detection (OPTIMIZED ✅)
- **Criteria**: ZERO prior transactions only
- **API Calls**: 1 call for fresh (was 10)
- **Speed**: <1 second detection

### 5. Pump.fun Mint Detection (FIXED ✅)
- **Before**: Only checked top-level instructions (missed all mints)
- **After**: Checks inner instructions where mints actually happen
- **Verified**: Successfully detected mint `7mpm9jYaDY1p7PrKSH8bbWhaAyHhZJmShYL7T712pump`

## 🎯 Complete System Flow

```
1. CEX Wallet Monitored
   └─ WebSocket subscription on DwdrYTtTWHfnfJBiN2RH6EgPbquDQLjZTfTwpykPEq1g

2. Transaction Detected (Real-time)
   └─ Account change event → Fetch recent transactions
   └─ Analyze balance changes → Find recipient

3. New Wallet Saved
   └─ Recipient wallet saved to database
   └─ Event: 'new_wallet' broadcast to frontend

4. Wallet Analysis (Background, queued)
   └─ Fetch 10 transactions (check if fresh)
   └─ If not fresh: fetch up to 1000 for age/count
   └─ Update database with analysis
   └─ Event: 'wallet_analyzed' broadcast

5. Pump.fun Monitoring (Automatic)
   └─ Check wallet transactions every 30 seconds
   └─ Look for pump.fun program interactions
   └─ Check INNER INSTRUCTIONS for mint
   └─ Event: 'token_mint' broadcast when found

6. Frontend Display
   └─ Show new wallets in real-time
   └─ Show fresh/established status
   └─ Show token mints from monitored wallets
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Wallet Detection
**Expected Flow:**
1. CEX sends SOL to brand new wallet
2. System detects transaction in <1 second
3. Wallet saved immediately
4. Analysis queued (non-blocking)
5. Result: `isFresh: true, previousTxCount: 0`

**How to Test:**
- Start system: `npm run dev`
- Wait for CEX wallet to send SOL
- Check console for: `✨ Fresh wallet detected - zero transactions!`

### Scenario 2: Established Wallet Detection
**Expected Flow:**
1. CEX sends SOL to wallet with history
2. System detects transaction
3. Wallet analyzed (fetches up to 1000 txs)
4. Result: `isFresh: false, previousTxCount: X, walletAgeDays: Y`

**How to Test:**
- Same as above, but wallet has prior transactions
- Check console for: `📦 ESTABLISHED (Age: Xd, TXs: Y)`

### Scenario 3: Pump.fun Mint Detection
**Expected Flow:**
1. Monitored wallet creates pump.fun token
2. System polls wallet every 30 seconds
3. Finds transaction with pump.fun program
4. Checks inner instructions for `initializeMint2`
5. Mint detected and saved to database
6. Event broadcast to frontend

**How to Test:**
- Add test wallet to monitoring: `5Sa5XkAL9s1tj89jrU5MXE7pXncQh61wZr215ijvS639`
- System should detect historical mint
- Check console for: `🚀 NEW PUMP.FUN TOKEN MINT`

## ⚠️ What to Watch For

### Good Signs ✅
- No 429 rate limit errors
- No duplicate transaction processing
- `⏸️ Already processing, skipping...` messages (proves lock works)
- Fresh wallets detected quickly
- Pump.fun mints show up in logs

### Bad Signs ❌
- `429 Too Many Requests` errors (rate limit issue)
- Same transaction processed multiple times (deduplication broken)
- Signers logged instead of recipients (detection broken)
- No mints detected for known pump.fun wallets (inner instruction check broken)

---

## 🚀 Ready to Launch!

**Start the system:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Monitor in browser:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

**What to expect:**
1. Real-time wallet detection as CEX sends SOL
2. Fresh wallet analysis with zero API bottlenecks
3. Automatic pump.fun monitoring for all detected wallets
4. Mint notifications when wallets create tokens

**All systems are GO! 🎯**
