## UI Component

### UserDataManagement.tsx

React component with complete UI for data management:

**Features:**
- Real-time data summary display
- One-click data export
- Individual delete buttons per data type
- Nuclear delete option with confirmation
- Success/error message display
- Loading states
- Disabled state when not authenticated

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { UserDataManagement } from '../components/UserDataManagement';

function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserDataManagement />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Security

### Authentication
- All endpoints protected by `SecureAuthService.authenticateRoute`
- Cookie-based authentication with JWT
- User ID extracted from authenticated request
- No user can access or delete another user's data

### Safety Mechanisms

**Selective Deletion:**
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- "Are you sure?" prompt with data type name
- Cannot be undone warning

**Complete Deletion:**
- Two-step confirmation process
- Must type exact confirmation text: `DELETE_ALL_MY_DATA`
- Real-time validation of confirmation text
- Cancel button available at all times

### Data Isolation
- All queries filtered by authenticated `user_id`
- SQL queries use parameterized statements (SQL injection protection)
- Foreign key cascade deletes handled at database level
- No orphaned records left behind

## Database Tables Affected

### Telegram User Accounts
```sql
DELETE FROM telegram_user_accounts WHERE user_id = ?
```
- Removes authentication credentials
- Clears session strings
- Deletes profile data

### Telegram Bot Accounts  
```sql
DELETE FROM telegram_bot_accounts WHERE user_id = ?
```
- Removes bot tokens
- Clears bot configurations

### Monitored Chats
```sql
DELETE FROM telegram_monitored_chats WHERE user_id = ?
```
- Removes chat configurations
- Clears monitored user lists

### Detected Contracts
```sql
DELETE FROM telegram_detected_contracts WHERE user_id = ?
```
- Removes all contract detections
- Clears detection history
