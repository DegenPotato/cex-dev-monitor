fix: Disable HDRI temporarily due to format compatibility

ISSUE ENCOUNTERED:
- Uploaded 91MB nebula.hdr file to server successfully
- RGBELoader throws "Bad File Format: bad initial token" error
- File header is valid Radiance format (#?RADIANCE)
- Likely Three.js version compatibility issue

CURRENT STATE:
- hdriEnabled set to false
- Using black background with particle starfield
- Audio-reactive accretion disk working perfectly
- All other effects functional

BENEFITS OF CURRENT SETUP:
- Clean deep space aesthetic
- 20000 particle stars with orbital physics
- Audio-reactive effects on disk and bloom
- Fast loading (no 91MB HDRI download)
- No CORS or caching issues

TODO (OPTIONAL):
- Try different HDR file format or resolution
- Or keep black background as final design
- Particle starfield looks great on its own
