feat: Add singularity vortex animation for auth transition

SINGULARITY VORTEX SHADER:
- Swirling whirlpool effect inspired by water vortex physics
- Spiral patterns rotating inward toward center
- Color gradient: Deep purple → Cyan → White at center
- Pulsing center glow simulating singularity core
- Organic noise for realistic turbulence
- Additive blending for ethereal glow effect

ENHANCED TRANSITION ANIMATION:
- Camera approaches from z=15 to z=3 (observing distance, not inside)
- Camera rises to y=2 for optimal viewing angle
- 2 barrel rolls during approach (reduced from 4)
- Camera stabilizes and tilts down (-45°) to observe singularity
- Vortex fades in smoothly (uIntensity: 0 → 1.5)

BALANCED POST-PROCESSING:
- Bloom reduced from 50 to 8 (dramatic but visible)
- Lensing: 0.4 strength, 0.6 radius (moderate distortion)
- Chromatic aberration: 0.015 (subtle warping)
- FOV: 95° (immersive but not distorted)
- Ambient light: 0.8 (dim but visible)

CAMERA FINAL STATE:
- Position: (0, 2, 3) - Close observation point
- Rotation: (-45°, 0°, 0°) - Looking down at vortex
- FOV: 95° - Wide immersive view
- Duration: 3.5s total animation

AUTH MODAL SETUP:
- Transition completes at 3.5s
- User observes mesmerizing swirling vortex
- Perfect visual context for auth modal
- Modal will appear to emerge from singularity center
- Creates narrative: "Access granted from within the blackhole"

DOCUMENTATION:
- Created SINGULARITY_ANIMATION.md with complete specs
- Includes visual design, timing, and integration guide

Ready for auth modal integration at 3.5s mark
